C# is the language I currently use day to day, that's why I used this as my solution.

In the executable folder please execute the WealthSimple.exe with the input file path as argument. The final instructions will be output with ";" as delimiter.

A sample input file is provided, sampleInput.txt. There following is the assumption:
- it is a comma delimited file
- columns will always be in that order
- there will always be data in each column
- there will always be a header line

Any invalid entry will result in the ErrLog.txt file.
